<h1>History of Football</h1>
<div class="div1">Football (or soccer as the game is called in some parts of the world) has a long history. Football in its current form arose in England in the middle of the 19th century. But alternative versions of the game existed much earlier and are a part of the football history.</div>
<h1>Football’s Origins</h1>
<div class="div1"><img src="CSS/Images/kemari.JPG" class="img3" id="chimg2" onclick="change2();">When talking about the origins of football it’s important to draw up a distinction between the game as we know it today and any sport that involved using your feet to kick a ball. That’s because if you’re talking purely about the latter then you’ll travel all the way back to the second and third centuries BC in your search for a reference to a game played with the feet.
    The Chinese military used to play a game called Tsu' Chu, which involved the kicking of a ball made of leather and filled with hair and feathers through a small opening and into a net. The player wasn’t allowed to use their hands bud had to make use of their body in order to hold off opponents who were trying to put them off by jumping on top of them. So a lot like playing against a Tony Pulis team.
    About 500 years later the Japanese invented a game called Kemari. This was less adversarial and more about working as a team to stop the ball from touching the ground. Like a more organised version of keepie-uppie, this game is still played today.

  <h1>The Development Of Official Rules</h1>
  <div class="div1"><img src="CSS/Images/rules.JPG" class="img3" id="chimg1" onclick="change();"> need to come up with some official rules for football became clear as the nineteenth century wore on. Different public school wanted to play games against each other but struggled to do so because each had their own set of laws and rules for the game. From the beginning of the 1840s representatives of England’s most prestigious public schools met in order to discuss rules that all would be happy with.
    The Cambridge Rules of 1848 were the first known set of laws laid down officially surrounding the game. They were also probably the closest of the first sets of rules to the ones later adopted officially by the Football Association. The rules allowed forward passes, for example, as well as throw-ins, goal kicks and they also forbade running whilst holding onto the ball.
    As is the case with most things in life, not everything went smoothly. Whilst the lads and lasses in Cambridge might have come up with some rules they were happy with, folk in Sheffield were playing by their own rules. They were officially formed in 1857 and were played by the newly created Sheffield Football Club. These rules were a lot closer to what we know of today as rugby, hence why there was so much confusion between the different ways that people played the game.<em style="color: red;"> Click on the image to change it  </em></div>
